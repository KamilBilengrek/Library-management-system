# Library management system

## Overview

Hello!  
My program can be used as a library management system. You can input names of people who lend books from library, books available in library and information on who lent which book.
All data will be saved in database named "library.db".  
This is a simple project I started to practice OOP basics and get a touch on it's concepts. I also decided to save data in a database to practice SQL language.  

### How to use program

1. Download ZIP
2. Extract
3. Run **main.py**

## My process

### Built with

* Python3
* Python3 OOP
* Python3 libraries:
    * tkinter

### Continued development

I'm just planning to complete TODO list I created using comments in source code.
